# vite-os

A simple front-end only app that replicates a basic operating system, written in vite+react.
Main purpose is to create a "sandbox-os" designed to learn more about React, framer-motion and vite.

It's impractical to make complex OS with traditional web technologies, but getting close
is possible. The goal of this project is to get close.
